## Design Choices

For our project, we chose a colour palette inspired by a beautiful Cornish beach. We opted for blue and yellow as the primary colours. The blue represents the rolling waves of the sea, while the yellow reflects the Cornish sand. The golden yellow also features in the Cornish logo.

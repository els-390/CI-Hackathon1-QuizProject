## Quiz page

 The quiz page presents questions and possible answers, with buttons clearly delineated against their background. 
 
 There is clear feedback when a user selects and then commits an answer. 
 
 It lets you know the correct answer if you were wrong. There is also an updating score display. 

 There is a restart button in case the user decides they want to start again.

## Design Choices

We selected a rich and colourful style, using bright high contrast colours. We want the user to feel immersed in the experience of visiting our website. We derived our colours from https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/
“Bright Accent Colors”
#242582
#553D67
#F64C72
#99738E
#2F2FA2

We selected the font style Poppins 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'. It works well as a fun, slightly futuristic, slightly unusual font; but not unusual enough to overpower the rest of the page.

## Wire Frames

We have included the wireframes for each stage of the user journey including the inital page, the quiz page and the final page.

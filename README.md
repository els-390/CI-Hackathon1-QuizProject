<h2>Introduction</h2>

**Kernow Know-How** by Kernow Coders is an online quiz designed to allow users to test and enhance their knowledge of Cornwall.

Suitable for a broad target audience from age 12 upwards, the is resource could also be used by older primary school aged children, for example when doing a school project. The quiz will provide 10 questions selected randomly from a bank of suitable material.

Future additions will enable the user to test and enhance their knowledge on a wide variety of topics after they have completed the Cornish section of the quiz as well as allowing them to enter their details to save their progress.

## Main Page

The user is greeted with a beautiful image of a Cornish beach to tie in with the theme of the quiz.

It displays the Kernow Know-How brand logo clearly for brand recognition. Future features will provide the option to share the page and the user's scores with friends and family on social media.

A simple but effective start button is present so that the user knows immediately how to begin the game.

## Design Choices

For our project, we chose a colour palette inspired by a beautiful Cornish beach. We opted for blue and yellow as the primary colours. The blue represents the rolling waves of the sea, while the yellow reflects the Cornish sand. The golden yellow also features in the Cornish logo.

## Fixed Bugs / Issues

<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Bug/Issue</th>
    <th>Resolution</th>
  </tr>
  <td>The Reset button would not appear after the last question.</td>
     
  <td>We moved the function to an earlier point in the call list to ensure this function was called first. </td>
  </tr>
      
  </tr>
    <td>The answer buttons would not shrink to fit on mobile screen</td>
    <td>We added media queries to aid responsiveness</td>
  </tr>
      
  </tr>
    <td>The answer buttons were appearing on the end message when the media query was hit for small devices.</td>   
    <td>Issue was caused by the query applying display flex to the answers container, and overriding the display none value. This was fixed by creating a function that hides each answer button element individually.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>The questions were not shuffling properly from the original array.</td>
    <td>The issue was that the return of the shuffle function was not returning the correct values. This was fixed by correcting an issue in the arrow function used to assign the random number to the sort method.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

## Unfixed Bugs / Issues

<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Bug/Issue</th>
    <th>Resolution</th>
  </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>If a user gets 10 question wrong in a row, then the statement applying hide to the score counter suddenly appears as 0 when the results message is given.</td>
  <td>We ran out of time to fix this, but it would be a simple matter of adding a statement to alter the class only if it is already in a specific state.</td>

<h1>Kernow Know-How README.MD</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

**Kernow Know-How** by Kernow Coders is an online quiz designed to allow users to test and enhance their knowledge of Cornwall. 

Suitable for a broad target audience from age 12 upwards, the is resource could also be used by older primary school aged children, for example when doing a school project. The quiz will provide 10 questions selected randomly from a bank of suitable material.

Future additions will enable the user to test and enhance their knowledge on a wide variety of topics after they have completed the Cornish section of the quiz as well as allowing them to enter their details to save their progress. 


## Main Page 

The user is greeted with a beautiful image of a Cornish beach to tie in with the theme of the quiz.

It displays the Kernow Know-How brand logo clearly for brand recognition. Future features will provide the option to share the page and the user's scores with friends and family on social media.

A simple but effective start button is present so that the user knows immediately how to begin the game.

## Design Choices

We selected a rich and colourful style, using bright high contrast colours. We want the user to feel immersed in the experience of visiting our website. We derived our colours from https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/
“Bright Accent Colors”
#242582
#553D67
#F64C72
#99738E
#2F2FA2

We selected the font style Poppins 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'. It works well as a fun, slightly futuristic, slightly unusual font; but not unusual enough to overpower the rest of the page.

## Wire Frames
